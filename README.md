# CV_in_developing
This is a project, and the goal is to show my journey on frontend developing, and more.
I want to create a website for my CV, and the final look to be something like a game, where you can travel throu my CV and take different paths, 
for instance, my projects using Java, JavaScrip, C#, Unity, and so on. 
- 1st phase is simple: only using HTML 
- 2nd phase: styling more properly with CSS 
- 3rd Adding functionality with JavaScript 
- 4th turning into a game, where the user can interect with the informations using an avatar that he create
